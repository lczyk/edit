"""Actions the menubar advertises must actually respond to their chord.

toggle_word_wrap, focus_statusbar and open_about all had an Action entry, a
keybindings.toml key, a line in doc/src/keybindings.md and a menu item that
displayed their configured chord -- but no code path ever consumed that chord.
Rebinding them, or using the shipped default, did nothing. Word wrap toggled
only via a hardcoded Alt+Z inside the textarea, which no config could move.
